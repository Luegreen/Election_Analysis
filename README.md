2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.

## A business case for future uses
This election summary was run with a script that can be used easily for many election results. If the election has more specific detail than county, like city for example, that information can easily be added to the script by copying any county information, pointing the code to the column that has city specific data. If the election is for multiple roles, like School Board and City Council, the code can simply be duplicated and specified for each role.
